# Personal Websites

As a software-engineer with a passion for new technology and coding in general, I love trying out new stuff and building stuff on my own, preferrably for free.

One such project can be a personal website. I mainly saw this as an opportunity to learn about technologies that I can't use at work. Also there's the added benefit of attaching a CV and some blog-articles to get yourself out there and to contribute back to the community.

My goal is to eventually host my website using a cluster-based cloud-provider and paying as little as possible, but I'm not there yet.

# The Easiest Option: USERNAME.github.io

If you haven't heard about GitHub-Pages yet, you should definitely take a look. It's a service from GitHub that let's users serve static-page-content. To get started, just create a repository called `yourusername.github.io` and add a few markdown-files. The GitHub-Pages-environment will automatically be activated and try to build your content using a static-site-generator called Jekyll. After the build, GitHub-pages will serve the resulting content under the URL https://yourusername.github.io.

You could also write your own HTML- and CSS-files and have them deployed via GitHub-pages. There are some impressive sites out there using exactly this technique.

# Using Hugo as an alternative to Jekyll

I wanted to explore the field of static-site-generators a bit and stumpled upon Hugo. Hugo is a static-site-generator written in Go and markets itself as the "fastest static-site-generator" out there. It's build-speeds are really impressive.

The workflow for Hugo is to initialize a new Hugo-project via Hugos cli and add one of the readily available themes via a git-submodule to the `/themes`-directory.

I first chose the Coder-theme and later settled on Hugo-Papermod, as it offers more flexibility and can basically be used as a clone of a Coder-themed website.

After adding the theme, you have to edit the toplevel config-file. This config-file can be written in a variety of formats. The default seems to be `config.toml`, but you can also write a `config.yaml` or `config.json`, if you prefer that.

When the config-file is ready, you can add some content in the form of HTML- or Markdown-files. You would add these in the `content/`-directory.

To generate the static site, you would simply execute the `hugo`-command from the project-root and in a matter of milliseconds (literally!) the site is built inside the `public`-directory.

Normally, you would observe the build output using `hugo serve`, but you can also take a look at the built site. If you have Python installed, this can for example be achieved by running the following snippet from the `public`-directory:

```python
python -m http.server
```

## Deploying a Hugo-Site with GitHub-Pages

As noted above, Jekyll builds the content automatically, when you push to a repository with an active GitHub-pages-environment. However this doesn't work for Hugo.

The best way that I've found to serve a Hugo-site is to use two separate repositories:

Host the actual Hugo-code inside of one repository and then add the `username.github.io`-repository as a submodule inside of the `public`-directory! You could even automate building the site and pushing the build-artifacts with a GitHub-Workflow!

This worked flawless for me. However, I wasn't satisfied with Hugo.

## The Problem with High-Level-Frameworks

I consider a Hugo-Project to be pretty high-level. The user is basically expected to set stuff up once and only add content afterwards. The layout is either vanilla Markdown or manually edited HTML.

This became a problem, when I wanted to add a CV to my website.

I first typed out the content in Markdown, but it became obvious pretty quickly, that the result wouldn't be very readable. The headings where far too verbose and long. I wouldn't be able to send a link to this page to anyone requesting further information about me personally.

The other option I considered was to write the whole thing in plain HTML. This would have worked, however the layout would have to be responsive in order to be useful for mobile devices. Writing responsive layouts in plain HTML and CSS is possible, but cumbersome.

I'm writing a lot of React at my job and the need for a component-based library and a CSS-framework became obvious to me.

There is the option of including React in a Hugo site, but I honestly didn't look much deeper into how this could be set up. Who knows, when the next inflexibility will strike? I wouldn't want to adapt themes for example.

When using a high-level-framework, you lock yourself in on how it expects its users to work. For most of the users this is the right approach, however I wanted more flexibility.

I looked further and found Next.js.
